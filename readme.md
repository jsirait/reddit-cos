# Audience-based news source characterization using probabilistic matrix factorization

This repo contains the implementation of probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) algorithms (specifically 
Gaussian and Poisson matrix factorization) to extract embeddings / representations of news sources 
based on the interaction data between news source and subreddits in which they are shared. 

`COS513_Final.pdf` contains the details of the PMF algorithms application on the news sources - subreddits 
interaction data. 

`all_notebooks/` contains all notebooks used in analyses.

`data` contains all data (raw and processed).

`final_representations` contains the final representations / embeddings of news sources used in the usefulness 
evaluations.
