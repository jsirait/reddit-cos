# Audience-based news source characterization using probabilistic matrix factorization

This repo contains the implementation of probabilistic matrix factorization algorithms (specifically 
Gaussian and Poisson matrix factorization) to extract embeddings / representations of news sources 
based on the interaction data between news source and subreddits in which they are shared.
